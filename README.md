Diagnostic Tests for the Amstrad CPC

This test is intended to be run from the low ROM of the Amstrad CPC at startup.
* Lower RAM test (errors reported with bars on border).
* Upper RAM test (64K).
* Dandanator build only: Check the low system ROM is valid.
* Check that upper system ROMs are valid.
* Detect CRTC model.

When the test is first launched, it starts by verifying that the lower 64KB of RAM are working correctly. If any faults are detected, the test stops with a screen like this. The numbers indicate the data bits, and the ones in red are faulty and the ones in green are working correctly. A faulty bit indicates a faulty IC.

Then, if it detects the upper 64KB of RAM, it runs some tests to verify that memory is working correctly. Otherwise, it shows the error and points to the faulty ICs (on a CPC 6218).

Finally it does some checks on the system ROMs to make sure they match known ROMs and they're not corrupted. It also detects the CRTC type.


# TODO
* Better RAM tests
* Detect addressing problems vs bit problems
* Identify ROMs in more languages
* Detect Plus range
* Different IC numbers if detecting CRTC 4?
* Sound, keyboard, and joystick tests
* Maybe disk controller tests
