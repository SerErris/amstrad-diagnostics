Diagnostic Tests for the Amstrad CPC

Right now it does three things:
* Lower RAM test (errors reported with bars on border).
* Upper RAM test (64K).
* Check that upper system ROMs are valid.
* Detect CRTC model.

# TODO
* Check system lower ROM
* Identify ROMs in more languages
* Detect Plus range.
* Different IC numbers if detecting CRTC 4?
